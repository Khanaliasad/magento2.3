
To create a .phtml file in a child theme in Magento, follow these steps:

Create a new directory in your child theme named Magento_Theme. This directory will be used to store all of your theme-related files.

Inside the Magento_Theme directory, create a new directory named templates. This directory will be used to store all of your .phtml files.

Create your .phtml file inside the templates directory.

Your .phtml file should contain the HTML and PHP code that you want to display on the frontend of your Magento store.

Once you have created your .phtml file, you can reference it in your layout XML files using the following syntax:
<code>
<block class='Magento\Framework\View\Element\Template' name='block_name' template='Magento_Theme::templates/file_name.phtml' />
</code>

Replace block_name with the name of your block and file_name.phtml with the name of your .phtml file.

<i>i used the following code in my file</i>   
<code>
<block class='Magento\Framework\View\Element\Template' name='block_name' template='Naheed_Mytheme::templates/file_name.phtml' />
</code>

Save your changes and clear the Magento cache.
Your .phtml file should now be displayed on the frontend of your Magento store.

You can put the block in the desired location in your Magento project's XML layout files. Here are some common locations to consider:

Custom theme layout file: If you have created a custom theme in Magento, you can add the block to your theme's layout file located at app/design/frontend/Naheed/mytheme/Magento_Theme/layout/default.xml.

Custom module layout file: If you have created a custom module in Magento, you can add the block to your module's layout file located at app/code/Naheed/MyModule/view/frontend/layout/my_layout.xml.

CMS page or block: If you want to add the block to a specific CMS page or block, you can do so by editing the CMS page or block and adding the block using the "Layout Update XML" field in the "Design" tab.

Keep in mind that the specific location to add the block will depend on your project's structure and requirements.
